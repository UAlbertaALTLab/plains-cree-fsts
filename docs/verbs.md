How to generate verbs
=====================

“Verb“ is an umbrella category for _four_ parts-of-speech in Plains Cree:

 - VTA (🧑🏽 ➡️ 🧑🏽): Transitive Animate Verb
 - VTI (🧑🏽 ➡️ 📦): Transitive Inanimate Verb
 - VAI (🧑🏽 ➡️): Animate Intransitive Verb
 - VII (📦 ➡️): Inanimate Intransitive Verb

These parts-of-speech differ in how many animate (🧑🏽 ➡️) arguments they
have, and the words increase in conjugations, the more animate arguments
they have.

### Template

    {lemma}+V+TA+{Order}+{Tense}+{Actor}+{Goal}

    Prefixes := (({Reduplication})*{Preverb}])*{Reduplication}*
    Tense := Prs | Pst | Fut
    Order := Ind | Cnj | Imp
