How to generate anything that's not a noun or verb
==================================================

In Cree, the linguists call just anything that's not a noun or a verb, an
<dfn>undeclinable particle</dfn>. “Undeclinable” means that there is
only one inflection of the word (phew!) and “particle” means that we
can't be bothered to give it a more specific category.

Template
--------

The template for these words is:

    {lemma}+Ipc

Yes! Just the lemma, followed by the `+Ipc` tag!

Examples
--------

 - "êkwa" = `êkwa+Ipc`
 - "mâna" = `mâna+Ipc`
 - "ôma" = `ôma+Ipc`
 - "kîkway" = `kîkway+Ipc`
 - "êkosi" = `êkosi+Ipc`
